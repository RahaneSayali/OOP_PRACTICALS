# OOP_PRACTICALS
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code around objects. Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. 

OOP promotes concepts like encapsulation, where data is hidden and accessed through methods; inheritance, allowing classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes; and polymorphism, enabling objects to be treated as instances of a common superclass. 

By using OOP, code becomes modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. It enhances code organization, readability, and scalability, making it a widely adopted approach in various programming languages for building complex and structured applications.
